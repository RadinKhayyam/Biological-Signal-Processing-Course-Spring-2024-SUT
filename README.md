## üìò Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth exploration of biological signal processing with a focus on both deterministic and stochastic signal models. Students will learn the fundamental principles of signal processing as applied to biological systems, including methods for analyzing, modeling, and filtering signals from the brain, heart, muscles, and other biological sources. Topics include time and frequency domain analysis, spectral estimation, adaptive filtering, and classification techniques. By the end of the course, students will be well-equipped to understand and implement advanced algorithms used in biomedical applications and research.
